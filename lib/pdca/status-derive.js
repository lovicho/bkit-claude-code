/**
 * The PDCA phase as the documents on disk state it (issue #156).
 *
 * `pdca-status.json` is a cache of something the documents already carry: a
 * `{feature}.plan.md` under the plan directory means that feature reached the
 * plan phase, whoever did or did not record it. Until now the read had no second
 * source, so every way the WRITE can fail surfaced identically as "no phase at
 * all" — a Stop handler that could not resolve the feature, the requireDocs
 * gate skipping, a crashed hook, a session that wrote nowhere.
 *
 * Derivation is a read-only fallback. Nothing here writes, and the stored status
 * still wins wherever it is ahead: `do` has no deliverable of its own, so a
 * feature recorded as `do` must not be pulled back to `design` by a derivation
 * that can only see documents.
