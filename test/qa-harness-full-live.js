/*
 * qa-harness-full-live.js — v2.1.34 exhaustive live QA
 *
 * Drives REAL Claude Code sessions with the plugin loaded from the working tree
 * and checks every surface bkit ships: each skill as a slash command, each agent
 * as a dispatch target, each hook event as an observed dispatch, and each MCP
 * tool over a real stdio session.
 *
 * ## Why exhaustive, and not a sample
 *
 * v2.1.33's live QA covered thirteen cases. Everything it touched worked. The
 * defects this release fixes were all in what it did not touch: a hook that had
 * never fired since v2.1.1, a matcher that covered Write but not Edit, a quality
 * gate that reported 100% for a feature that did not exist. Sampling cannot find
 * a dead surface, because a dead surface looks exactly like an unsampled one.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * Each live case is a real session (roughly 20-90s). The full sweep is long by
 * construction. `--layer` narrows it; `--list` prints the plan without running.
 *
 *   node test/qa-harness-full-live.js                 # everything
 *   node test/qa-harness-full-live.js --layer skills
 *   node test/qa-harness-full-live.js --layer hooks,mcp
 *   node test/qa-harness-full-live.js --list
 *
 * Results are written to .bkit/runtime/full-live-qa.json so a run can be
 * inspected, diffed, and cited rather than remembered.

// Code leaves fork mode OFF (code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents). So this

// whose default flipped in v2.1.232 — the one that removes the Agent tool's

// well" (sub-agents.md). Setting CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1 puts a scripted
// session on the same code path the interactive default now takes, which is the
// thing worth testing.

// mode — it does not, by construction, because the result arrives after the turn
// ends. It asserts the failure is HONEST: an unmeasured gate rather than a
