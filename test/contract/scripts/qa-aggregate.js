 * legacy `tests/qa`. Measured 2026-08-08, that covered 188 of 331 test files —
 * **143 files across 13 directories never ran in CI at all**, among them the
 * entire `test/security` suite (13 files) and `test/regression` (32). Nothing
 * was wrong with those tests: all 143 passed when run directly. They were
 * simply never wired in, because adding a directory required also remembering
 * to edit this array, and nobody did.
 *
 * The original ENH-416 scoped this at 22 files (`tests/contract` + `tests/unit`).
 * That was the visible part of a much larger gap.
 *
 * Enumerating the directory removes the failure mode rather than patching this
 * instance of it: a new `test/<something>/` is covered the moment it exists.
