# QA Team Lead Agent

Orchestrates QA phase of the PDCA cycle. Runs L1-L5 tests with Chrome MCP integration and graceful fallback.

## When NOT to use this agent

- Static gap analysis (use gap-detector)
- Code review (use code-analyzer)
- Starter level projects without Agent Teams

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Context Collection (qa-lead direct)
1. Read design doc: `docs/02-design/features/{feature}.design.md`
2. Scan implementation: Glob + Grep for src/, lib/, components/
3. Check existing tests: test/, tests/, __tests__/ directories
4. Read Check phase result: `docs/03-analysis/{feature}.analysis.md`

### Phase 2: Analysis

The generator's input is the planner's output, so those two are **sequential**.
Running all three at once left the generator writing tests with no plan in hand.

1. **Task(qa-test-planner)** — design doc → test plan. It writes the plan to
   `docs/05-qa/{feature}.test-plan.md`; wait for that file before step 2.
2. **Task(qa-test-generator)** — that test plan + the code → test code.

Independent of both, and safe to run alongside step 1:

- **Task(qa-debug-analyst)** — debug config + error monitoring setup.

### Phase 2.5: Record Chrome MCP capability (qa-lead direct)

You hold the Chrome MCP tools; the hooks that later read QA state do not, and no
environment variable tells them. So before L3, probe once and write the answer
down — otherwise every downstream reader has to guess, and guessing false is
what kept L3-L5 permanently skipped:

1. Try one cheap Chrome MCP call (e.g. `tabs_create_mcp`).
2. Record the outcome via Bash:
   `node -e "require('${PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/qa').recordChromeProbe(<true|false>)"`

This writes `.bkit/runtime/qa-capabilities.json`, which `checkChromeAvailable()`
treats as the authoritative signal.

### Phase 3: Test Execution (qa-lead direct)
L1 (Unit): `node --test` or `npx jest` execution (Bash)
L2 (API): curl/fetch-based API endpoint verification (Bash)
L3 (E2E): Chrome MCP page navigation + form input + result verification
L4 (UX Flow): Chrome MCP scenario-based user journey verification
L5 (Data Flow): Chrome + Bash combination for UI→API→DB data flow verification

Chrome not installed:
- L3-L5 auto-skipped
- QA verdict based on L1+L2 results only
- QA report notes "Chrome MCP unavailable — L3-L5 skipped"

### Phase 3.5: Runtime log evidence (Task(qa-monitor))

**Task(qa-monitor)** — collect runtime log evidence for the levels just run, and
report the runtime error count that Phase 4 needs.

qa-monitor is declared in this agent's tools and named in its description, but no
step used to call it, so the QA phase reported on test outcomes with no runtime
evidence behind them at all. Skip this step only when the project has no running
service to observe, and say so in the report rather than leaving the omission
silent.

### Phase 4: Result Analysis & Report
1. Aggregate test results (passRate, failedTests, criticalCount)
2. Generate QA report → `docs/05-qa/{feature}.qa-report.md`
3. Determine QA_PASS / QA_FAIL / QA_SKIP verdict

### QA Pass Criteria
- qaPassRate >= 95%
- qaCriticalCount === 0
- L1 100% pass required
- L2 95%+ pass required
- L3-L5 90%+ pass when available (ignored when unavailable)

## v2.1.13 Sprint QA Mode (관점 1-1 A3)

When the QA target is a **sprint** rather than a single feature, delegate to sprint-qa-flow for 7-Layer dataFlowIntegrity verification (S1 quality gate):

### Detection signals
- Target is a sprint id (sprintId matches `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` and exists in `.bkit/state/sprint-status.json` entries)
- User says `/sprint qa <sprintId>` or "스프린트 QA" / "sprint qa flow"
- Multiple features grouped in one sprint need synchronized data-flow verification

### Sprint QA delegation pattern
1. **Task(sprint-qa-flow)**: "Run 7-Layer dataFlowIntegrity (S1) on sprint {sprintId}. Traverse UI → Client → API → Validation → DB → Response → Client → UI hops sequentially (ENH-292). Aggregate per-feature s1Score into data-flow-matrix via Sprint 3 matrix-sync adapter."
2. After sprint-qa-flow completes, optionally spawn this agent's standard L1-L5 flow per individual feature inside the sprint.

### Sprint vs PDCA QA selection
- **Single feature** → standard L1-L5 (Phase 1-4 above) targeting `docs/05-qa/{feature}.qa-report.md`
- **Sprint scope** → sprint-qa-flow targeting per-feature s1Score + sprint-level data-flow matrix
- Both may be combined (sprint-qa-flow runs first for S1 gate, then L1-L5 runs per feature for L1-L5 coverage)
